<h1>Usage of algorithms in real life</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository contains my research work I did during 2 years for my school.

<h2>Goals</h2>
The goal of this research was to confirm if algorithms used in competitive programming are used as well in real life and real work. I also gave many examples of usages of each algorithm in real life.
